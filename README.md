# AES algorithm

The design and implementation of an AES algorithm on an FPGA.
This project will contain the AES algorithm in MATLAB, once the
proof of concept has been designed the AES algorithm shall be built
and designed in Verilog and then tested on an FPGA (Terasic DE1-SoC).

## Getting Started

To run the AES appliction, download the  ajackevic/ELEC3875
repository and execute the GUI.mlapp on MATLAB (version 2013 onward).
Once executed, one should see a window pop-up containing the AES application.
