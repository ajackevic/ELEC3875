# AES algorithm

The design and implementation of an AES algorithm on an FPGA.
This project will contain the AES algorithm in MATLAB, once the
proof of concept has been designed the AES algorithm shall be built
and designed in Verilog and then tested on an FPGA (Terasic DE1-SoC).

## Getting Started

This section should contain information stating on how to execute the
script on ones own PC. Update this section once the MATLAB script has been
written. Mention how one only needs MATLAB online to run the script

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system
